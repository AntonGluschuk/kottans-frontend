## Git Basics

#### What's new?
1. Find out that Git is **distributed version control system**
2. There are exists next three areas: **working directory** - where all current local files, than after `git add` they come to **staging area** and after `git commit` they appear at the **repo**.
3. Good advices: always make `git status` command after any other commands and when creating some new feature always make `git branch --name--` new branch.
4. **.gitignore** file is useful when you need to prevent some files(e.g images, logs etc.) from adding them to the repo.
5. After use `git log` it's very convinient to use next commands for navigation in **CMD**:
  - **scroll down**
  - **d**-move half page screen or **f**-move whole page screen
  - **scroll up**
  - **u**-move half page screen or **b**-move whole page screen
6. Learned different types of log viewing by using next commands `git log --oneline`, `git log --stat`, `git log -p`.
7. Also `git show` useful command for a single commit.
8. `git diff` - shows changes in a local files before commiting.
9. For making undo **after** last incorrect commit make `git commit --amend`.
10. `git reset` is good for local repo - erase commit/ `git revert` is nice for remote repo - make a copy of commit with opposite state.
